# ws-qotes

Project to collect all works of William Shakespeare and make them easily searchable for quotes.

# Scraping

MIT hosts a website with all the plays/poems of W. S. [here](http://shakespeare.mit.edu/index.html). I wrote a simple python script to go through the whole website to collect every line in every play.
Eventually this will be converted into a SQL database, but for now that is all being stored in JSONs.
